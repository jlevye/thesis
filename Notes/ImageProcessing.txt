Notes for creating leaf traces in GIMP.
Requires GIMP plug-in "gimp-ace2-0.6.7".

From plain scans:
1. Crop image as close as possible to bounds of leaf.
2. (Optional) Adjust contrast and brightness.
3. Export image as .tif file; name = label from leaf image. (Code or species name.) Save in "Images" folder of parent directory.

With a cropped leaf image:
1. Create a duplicate layer. Protect and hide the original image. Name new layer "Trace".
3. Desaturate image.
3. Using "Adaptive Contrast" tool (Filters -> Colors -> Adaptive Contrast...).
    a. Strength, brightness, iterations should be default.
    b. Detail size = 5, Smoothing = 75, any method that uses "+correctdark" works. Use discretion. Goal = even background with distinct vein lines.
    c. (Optional): Use Color -> Auto -> White Balance to convert gray background to white.
4. Use "Threshold" tool to convert gray-scale to binary image. Light should cut off right where gray background is still registered as white. Use best judgement.
5. Make background of trace transparent: "Layer -> Color to Alpha..."
6. Set trace color to a similar level of luminosity as the pink image. Select all the black, and then use fill tool and chose a comfortable gray. You should now see a gray trace over the pink image.
6. Create a 3rd layer, transparent background, on top. Label it "Points".
7. Move systematically around image, correcting errors in the trace and marking points.
8. When finished, delete the layer with the image, and use "Export Layers" plug-in to save each layer. 


ImageJ functions to get the center locations of a image of points:
open("/home/jen/Desktop/dots.png");
run("8-bit");
run("Analyze Particles...", "display");
run("Set Measurements...", "centroid redirect=None decimal=3");
saveAs("Results", "/home/jen/Desktop/testpoints.csv");
close();
