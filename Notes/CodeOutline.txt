Program Structure
Import File/Files
- Need cases for batch analysis vs individual
- file I/O code
	- go to given file name or folder name
	- if folder, read file names into list to iterate over
	- keep control of working directory
Color/Contrast Correction
- Use ImageMagick commands in python shell
	- Adjust contrast
	- Threshold to b&w
	- Rough edge detection?
Intersection/Node detection algoritm
	- Number nodes moving through image: possibly assign number to pixel location?
	- Identify edges and adjacency
		- Degree matrix from adjacency matrix? 
		- Adjacency list? Less RAM use 
	- Edge lengths (& widths?)

Analysis
	- Centrality
	- Shortest geodesic path
	- Maxiumum flow
	- Minumum cut
	- Eigenvalues
