# R Tutorials for Bioinformatics
***Jen Teshera-Levye***

***University of Minnesota***

The following tutorials were written primarily for students in BIOL 2002/3004 at the University of Minnesota - they're based around the projects analyzing the diversity of human microbiomes for that course. However, they focus on core skills in working with data - setting up and merging data frames, running some basic statistical tests, plotting, and troubleshooting, and so may be useful to students learning R in any field or any course.

All of the data files, as well as the R Markdown source for these tutorials, are available on my [Github](github.com/jlevye/teaching). They assume a current version of R is installed (available through [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)); using [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is optional but highly recommended.
